#script goal is to categorize set of words in 3 categories - professional, organizational and social
#whole set consists of 30 subsets(responses), 5 to 20 words each, separated by STOP string
#whole set is contained in slova.txt and is compared with each of 3 lists, which derive from slova_org.txt, slova_pro.txt and slova_soc.txt
#expected result is list, which contains 30 lists with 3 integers in each. integer is number of words from each category in each response

#initiating resulting counter 
counter=[]
for x in range(30):
	counter.append([0, 0, 0])

#creating lists, to which we will compare our words
